This is a project I've done in my free time. 

To start, create a database in phpmyadmin named test (or just name it whatever you like but also change it in dbcontroller.php) and use the SQL code in the Starting SQL.txt part to add the
necessary tables and insert some products.
After that insert the project into a php compiler and run index.php.
To truly access the site you will have to register a new user and then login with that user.


It serves as a passable e-commerce site with a working shopping cart, orders, order history and encrypted login system working through a database connection through xampp at phpmyadmin.
It is very bare bones as I did not implement an error system for user input, relying instead on the errors the database sends out. 

There is a page where you can debug the various basic interactions with the database: Create, Read, Update and Delete.
